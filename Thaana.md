Title: Thaana
status: draft

The Maldives, if you didn't know, are a small chain of islands in the Indian Ocean, off to the southwest of the southern tip of India. The language they speak there is Divehi. (This is all still background). I can't tell you much about Divehi—I think it's roughly similar to the other Indo-Aryan languages. But one thing I can tell you is that it's written in a script called [*Thaana*][1] which is very unlike its neighbors.

Most of the Indian scripts share a blood bond. There is a huge class of writing systems called the Brahmic scripts, all descended from the Brahmī script. These scripts will tend to have a similar appearance, similar set of characters, and similar function (not that they're the same, or all mutually readable!), and if you think of 'Indian writing' you've probably thought of one of them.

In the Maldives they speak an Indo-Aryan language, but their writing system doesn't look anything like Devanagari, Tibetan, Sinhala, or the rest. Instead it's a series of angled strokes and squiggles, of a sort.

It's beautiful: it's proportional, calligraphic, but with an almost constructionist elegance. You don't often see letters like that. It almost reminds you of the Ogham letters—the organizing structure of the character doesn't appear to be the rectangular bounding box but the notch. It looks like a series of notches along the horizontal rule.

And if [Wikipedia][2] is to be believed, it's got an outlandish origin to match its slightly alien appearance. I'm told that the script began as a secret writing system exclusively for magic and ritual, and that, uniquely I think, it was created by taking the numbers from the Arabic and Indo-Aryan writing systems and turning them sideways. And over time this ritual, hidden script was adopted for general use.

There's a lot to like about Thaana, and I've been intrigued by it for a while. I've had a long-standing interest in right-to-left scripts—partially because I like every kind of writing system unlike our own, and partially, I imagine, because I'm a lefty and thus I've been smudging my own handwriting for decades. This interest, then, has often led me to wonder what sort of script I could adapt to write English. (I've wanted to do the same thing with a vertical script, like [Manchu][3], but so far no dice). 

It's not just that Thaana runs right to left, and that it's so distinctive-looking. It's also, like its genetically unrelated neighbors,  an abugida—vowel sounds are not represented with letters, like consonants, but as diacritics that go above or below the full-fledged letter signs. This is quite novel to an English speaker, for reasons that will become clear.

So I figured I'd give it a shot and see if I could adapt Thaana to write English. 

![Thaana Alphabet][image-4]

The obvious first step in this kind of thing is to assemble an alphabet. Given the vast differences in function and type between Thaana and English, it's clear that we're looking at a system of *transcription*, rather than *transliteration*—using Thaana to write the sounds (phonemes) of English rather than reproduce the spelling of English words. In fact the Indo-Aryan languages are well-suited to this, and Thaana, which has been equipped by the Muslim Maldivians with letters for transcribing Arabic texts, particularly so. 

Thaana has letters to represent nearly every English consonant, except for /w/, which you have to double up with /v/. (Actually, if you like you can preserve even that distinction by borrowing from the Arabic transcription letters, but I'd like to keep things simple.) No great hardship, I don't think. In fact we can come up with a selection of letters that includes single symbols for sounds that English requires multiple letters for, like /sh/ and both /th/s, voiced and unvoiced. Finally, Thaana includes letters for sounds that don't exist in English at all, and thus can be eliminated from our adapted alphabet. This leaves us with a manageable character set.

![Thaana For English][image-5]

Once you've got the consonants down, things become more complicated. As I mentioned, one of the fun and interesting things about Thaana is that it's an abugida—instead of writing out vowels with the letters, you write diacritics around the letters to assign them vowel sounds. What one soon discovers is that this sort of approach is really best suited to languages with two properties:

1. They have a relatively small set of vowel sounds to choose from;
2. They have a paucity of consonant clusters, *ie*, most consonants are immediately followed by a vowel, so words tend to have a CVCV structure.

English falls down miserably at both of these requirements. As for vowels, we've got a lot: as an American English speaker, I could name around 11 distinct monophthong vowels that I need to be able to produce, and at least five diphthongs. Thaana can cover just five distinct vowels. As for consonant clusters—just the phrase 'consonant clusters' has five of them. 

I'll begin with the consonant cluster problem. Because an abugida expects a CVCV syllable structure, it will have a vowel sign called a *vowel-killer*—a diacritic that explicitly says, *no vowel comes after this consonant*. In Thaana that sign is the *sukun* and it takes the form of a small circle above the consonant in question. In English, you've got to ditch the *sukun*. If you had to write a sukun every time you had a consonant without a vowel—either in the middle of a cluster or at the end of a word—half your page would be small circles. So you have to sacrifice novelty and be more Englishy here—in our adapted system, a consonant without a vowel has no diacritic at all, and a consonant with no diacritic at all is simply pronounced without a vowel.

The vowel inventory problem in general is more concerning. Divehi has a simple system of five monophthong vowels, with long and short versions. That gives us (in addition to the proscribed *sukun*) five signs, each with a doubled version to indicate length.

At this point, unfortunately, we have to start mucking around with the system a little bit. The English and Divehi languages have fundamentally dissimilar vowel systems and as far as I can see, you can't—as with the consonants—simply take a subset or sampling of one to represent the other. You have to start repurposing things. In this repurposing we'll try to preserve the spirit of the original Thaana symbols as much as possible, and add as little foreign as we can, but this is the point at which we diverge.

Let's start with the low-hanging fruit: you'll notice that Divehi has no diphthongs, and that English has no vowel length differentiation. This provides our first opportunity: we can use Thaana's doubled vowel sign space to represent diphthongs instead of long vowels. This is very much in the spirit of those signs, I think. Diphthongs feel like the Anglophone cousins to the Indic long vowel. And actually, I have to complicate things a little more, and reconcile phonology with phonemics here—the way things sound with the way we hear them. Because in fact one of the five diphthongs I mentioned earlier—/oʊ/—doesn't actually *feel* like a diphthong to your average English speaker. That's actually the sound that you might call the 'long O' sound—the sound in 'bone' or 'blow'. In phonological reality it's got a little /u/ on the end of it. It's two sounds in one. But because it feels like one sound, it would be cruel to include it in the diphthongs. So that leaves four:

* /a:/ can stand for /ai/, like in *fire* or *bite*
* /e:/ can stand for /ei/, like in *blade* or *bait*
* /o:/ can stand for /oi/, like in *foil* or *point*
* /u:/ can stand for /au/, like in *found* or *bout*.

That just leaves us with the monophthongs (and their diphthong in monophthong's clothing, /oʊ/). All 12 or so of them. The vowel in *caught*, the vowel in *cot*, the vowel in *cat*, the vowel in *shove*… 

It's here that we must temporarily set down our phonemic aspirations. It's hardly possible to come up with a system of faithfully and unambiguously representing the vowel phonemes in the English language in our own alphabet, let alone someone else. Not when you consider how many different sets of words will be pronounced differently by someone from Boston, someone from Boise, and someone from Edinburgh. Not without resorting to the entire [IPA][4]. 

No, at this point we need to import some good old Anglophone ingenuity and move one step up the chain—from phonemes, or how we hear a particular linguistic sound, to how we *represent* that sound. We need to move from transcription to transliteration, if only for a moment. 

Because while we have 11 some-odd vowel sounds, we only have five vowels, just like our Indo-Aryan cousins: a, e, i, o, u. And happily that's the perfect number to put into a one-to-one correspondence with the vowel signs in the Thaana system. 

* /a/ can stand for *a*,
* /e/ can stand for *e*,
* /i/ can stand for *i* (and *y*, when its acting as a vowel)
* /o/ can stand for *o*,
* /u/ can stand for *u*.

This way, even if you and I pronounce *bath* with a completely different vowel, we can both know how to write it in our secret Maldivian writing system. 

## TODO: What do we do with *Good*?

Of course this isn't a perfect correspondence because there are lots of strange ways in English of spelling even the monophthongs: *ou* and *oo* and *ui* for /u/ and so on. The single vowel signs therefore bear a semantic burden just a little greater than I'd like. They have to stand for a very wide variety of spellings. I'm not crazy about this but it seems unavoidable. The only thing I can do is make use of the very last available symbol in our Thaana arsenal, the remaining long vowel symbol:

* /i:/ can stand for all the strange multiple-letter ways  that English has of spelling the sound /i/, as in bee and piece, receive, meat, and so on.

There's really only one kind of vowel that isn't an *a*-kind-of-vowel or a *e*-kind-of-vowel and so on: the schwa, /ə/, the reduced central sound that's the first vowel in *about*, the second vowel in *pencil*, the second vowel in *comma*, the second vowel in *photograph*, and elsewhere. It's everywhere, really, and as Anglophone as apple pie. To speed up writing I have decided to introduce this one last phonemic symbol—a single dot above the letter. That can stand for the schwa in its many environs.

So in the end, we have a sort of hybrid transcription/transliteration system that, I hope, preserves what's most interesting about the Thaana writing system: its distinctive appearance, its right-to-left orientation, its function as an abugida. As a representation of the English language, it's an interesting sort of hybrid that ultimately, I hope, avoids the pitfall that a lot of other romanization schemes fall into, where the shoehorning of lots and lots of vowels with an irregular representational scheme and widely varying pronunciation ends up with a system requiring quite a bit of sounding-out (I'm thinking of my experiences with Yiddish, written in a fully alphabetized version of Hebrew letters—"Men-het-n? Oh, right." and so on). It necessitates knowledge of English spelling, of course, but given that this is an aesthetic exercise or, at most useful, a template for secret communication between English speakers, this is not so much of a handicap.
