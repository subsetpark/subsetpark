Not infrequently (in a relative sense) do I bump into people who tell me,
"I want to learn how to play Bridge!" This is often delivered in an
excited, confessional tone, as though the speaker was just realizing
some essential truth.

The reasoning usually goes like this: the speaker likes games, maybe
grew up playing card games with their family, or maybe came to board
games later in life; they have come to a point where they appreciate the
usefulness of a card game as a matrix for pleasant socialization (they,
or people they spend time with, now have houses or apartments that are
sufficiently nice that it's not out of the question to spend an evening
at one with firends); and they have the sense that Bridge is *the* card
game of polite, sophisticated society. That either it's something worth
knowing as a form of currency of adulthood, or it's simply the best choice
for those of us who fancy ourselves to be polite, sophisticated adults.

I share this sense. After all, the Times ran a Bridge column until
2015. So I understand where they're coming from, and it's only mentally
that I respond with, 'no, you don't.'[^1]

[^1]: I can't overstate the ambivalence with which I make this
declaration. Even in writing this post I'm also imagining that I should
probably read some old issues of the Times column. At the very least
there may be material in there useful for players of other trick-taking
games. And maybe the conventions aren't as bad as I feel they are. I
know I've wondered that before, but still I wonder.

The last thing I want is to defuse a nascent card player's
enthusiasm. What I think---or hope---is underlying their interest is a
sense that the world of card games is vast and conducive to socialization
and, indeed, sophistication, subtlety and skill. And I make the assumption
that they have simply not heard of many of the games that I think of as
equal to Bridge in terms of sophistication (if not Anglophone reknown)
and so are *really* interested in learning a sufficiently deep strategic
card game, and not Bridge itself.

Because the fact is, I can barely stand Bridge.

Here are the things I like about Bridge: it's a deep game, highly reliant
on skill, with relatively little bravura but quite a bit of reasoning,
planning, and logical inference. Unfortunately, what I dislike about
Bridge is nearly everything that is peculiar to Bridge as distinct from
other members of the Whist family. I have absolutely no patience for what
strikes *me* as the defining feature of Bridge, the massive accretion
of [**conventions**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bridge_convention)
that have grown up around the bidding phase in a Bridge hand, where a
bid of a certain number of tricks in a certain suit is less a good-faith
assertion that one could win a contract of that shape and more a message
to one's partner about some specific feature of one's holdings, or a
request for information even, to be answered by some other previously
agreed-upon bid. And you know things have really gone off the rails
when you consider the fanaticism around authorized and unauthorized
information, where tournaments reliably will constrain players to
exchanging convention cards or bidding behind screens in order to ensure
that only a certain amount of predetermined and mutually understood
coding is being exchanged.

Anyway, what I hope and assume is that my interlocutors are not actually
interested in Bridge per se and probably don't even know about bidding
conventions. Because that gives us an opportunity to explore a wide
family of games that share what is enjoyable about Bridge without
bothering with the above.

# Whist

I think it's not unfair to think of Bridge as an elaboration that
almost entirely covers the simpler ancestral game of [Whist][]. Whist
(and therefore Bridge) is a plain-trick game played by four (in teams
of two) with a full 52-card deck without jokers, where all the cards
are dealt out and the aim is to take the greater number of tricks when
played at trumps. Any suit can be led to a trick; subsequent players
must follow suit if they can, and otherwise may play any other card. The
trick is taken by the highest trump played, or if no trump was played,
by the highest card of the suit that was led.

This core mechanism is surprisingly durable. A lot of what players like
about Bridge is already there: all the cards are in play, and there
are enough of them that it's not trivial (but also not too mysterious)
to project exactly how any hand will play out. I'd actually recommend
that anyone interested in Bridge start with simple Whist, especially if
they can find a partner willing to learn with them.

More to the point, I think it's very worthwhile to understand Whist
because it is demystifying to think of a number of the more complex
games we might be interested in as elaborations on Whist along one of
a number of different dimensions. Here are the dimensions in question:

- How the trump suit is determined;
- How teams are formed (or whether one player should play against the rest);
- How many tricks are required to constitute a win;
- What the role of the defenders will be;
- How winning a game should relate to a larger playing session.

Perhaps the most basic and most promising area for elaboration is
*how the trump suit is determined*. After all, whether a suit is trumps
or not will have an extraordinary amount to do with whether a hand is
a winner or not; by the exact same token, the choice of trumps is an
extremely valuable commodity which will go quite far in deciding who
will win the hand. So it feels a bit of a waste to leave it entirely up
to chance. We can enhance the richness of the game considerably by
introducing a more interesting mechanism for determining trumps.

It's also worth considering the reasoning behind introducing elaborations
at all. Very often, it's in order to *reward greater skill*. It is a
principle generally agreed upon that between two players who would like
the opportunity to name trumps (or otherwise decide what kind of game
to play), it's a good idea to give it to that player who is willing to
undertake the more difficult, and presumably more lucrative, sort of game.
