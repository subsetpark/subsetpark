title: A Curriculum of Vira
date: 2019-12-27
status: post

We often find when learning card games that they consist of what could be
called *first-order rules*, which are the core rules of a game, or the
ones that lend it its distinctive flavor, a *second-order* ones, which
probably arose as correctives or adjustments to styles of play under the
first order[^1]. This sort of thing is particularly.  difficult for those
of us who learn our card games out of books; whereas, in a traditional
folk setting, a new player would presumably start out at a simplified
level and additional dimensions would be introduced as they got a handle
on the rules, we get the whole thing dumped on us at once. Reading an
entire section like 'bidding' or 'bonuses', the bits that make up the
point of the game and the correctives and elaborations that have been
layered upon them are freely intermingled. For very few games---Bridge is
an exception that comes to mind---has there been documented a treatment
of the game for learners that increases gradually in complexity.

[^1]: To give an elementary example: in many tarok versions you can
announce or play *pagat ultimo*, whereby you score extra points by taking
the last trick with the lowest trump. This feat requires being able
to hold on to it until the last trick, of course, as well as ensuring
that everyone else has played all of theirs before it. If you want to
teach someone Slovenian Tarok, they need to know about pagat ultimo. On
the other hand, it's also true that if you announce pagat ultimo, *you
can't play it before you've played all your other trumps*. It's fair to
argue that this has nothing to do with the effect of pagat ultimo in the
game. But rather, as players developed the game, they sometimes dumped
the pagat early when they decided they couldn't make the bid, and it was
agreed that this somewhat ruined the effect that pagat ultimo had in the
game. In other words it's fair to imagine that a rule like "one cannot
prematurely play pagat ultimo unless forced to" is a *remedial* one.

The distinction between first- and second-order rules, and the usefulness
in being able to differentiate, seems particularly strong in the Swedish
plain-trick game Vira. Vira is famous (among certain types) for its
complexity; I would argue it's not nearly as complex as presented,
but it's also not an *elegant* game. It has lots of elaborations on
elaborations, the sort of additional wrinkles that would only really
make sense to an already-seasoned player. The point of Vira seems to
be to take a standard three-person whist game and absolutely maximize
the number of biddable hands. In fact the actual card play is extremely
simple and regular; all the effort and complexity, at least that which
is not purely incidental (like what denominations of scoring chips you
need and what shape they take), has gone into presenting a variety of
ways to turn one's hand into a contender to succeed at that play.

The effort manifests itself in the form of 40 different bids that players
can make[^2]. In addition, some of these bids have some odd one-off
rules around them so that everything is kept competitive. Finally, each
one can have a few different values based on how exactly the bid was
made. But things like what levels you can bid at, and exactly how many
chips you make or lose, are incidental. It would be useful to introduce
the core concepts of the game, keeping a couple printed tables at
hand. If we adopted an incremental strategy it might be quite simple to
learn indeed.

[^2]: That's 40 in the same way that Eskimos have 100 words for
snow. There's really only a handful of core bids---let's say 8---that
can be made at different levels. But the levels are quite easy to
differentiate among.

This article consists of a series of versions of the game of Vira. The
intention is for each version to be fully playable and coherent; at
the same time, for each version to build logically upon the concepts
in place in the previous one, in a way that demonstrably provides for
a greater degree of variety and skill.

# Basic Vira

## The deal

Vira is played with a normal 52-card deck. 3 players a hand; four players
can play, with the dealer sitting out each turn. Dealer rotates clockwise.

The dealer will deal 13 cards to each player, leaving a stock of 13 on
the table. Then bidding begins to the dealer's left.

## Bidding

Players take turns bidding in order. Each player can either bid a higher
bid than the current bid, or pass. Since earlier players always have
precedence, an earlier player can "hold" a later player's bid. When
two players have passed, the current bid wins and that player becomes
the declarer.

## Play

Forehand always leads. Trick play is exactly like whist, plain-trick with
a trump suit; players must follow suit if they can, and if not they can
decide whether to trump or discard. The declarer plays against the other
two, and tries to take a certain number of tricks with their choice of
trump suit.

## Bids

Many bids involve opponents exchanging cards with the stock. While the
procedure for the declarer exchanging cards is different depending on
the bid, the procedure for the opponents is always the same: the first
opponent discards and draws between 0 and however remain after the
declarer's exchange, and then the last opponent can do the same with
however many the first opponent left.

### Game (6-9)

This is the most basic bid. Bid at levels 6 through 9, where each number
is the number of tricks the declarer must make in order to make the
bid. Aside from the number of tricks, the levels are identical:

1. Declarer names their trump suit;
2. Declarer discards any number of cards and draws the same number from the stock;
3. Opponents exchange.

### Turn-one (6-8)

This bid is just like a normal *game*, except instead of declaring
trumps the declarer turns the top card of the stock, and that card's
suit becomes the trump suit. When the declarer exchanges, they must
exchange *at least* 1 card, which will be the card they turned.

### Turn-two (6-8)

Just like *turn-one*, except the declarer turns the top 2 cards and chooses
among them for the trump suit. They must exchange at least two cards,
starting with the two they turned up.

### Turn-three

Just like *turn-two*, but with 3.

# Vira with preference

We can increase the number of possible bids by naming a single suit
as *the suit of preference*. It doesn't matter which one; it can be
determined before every hand, or named once for the whole game. For these
instructions we'll assume that ♥ is always preference, in analogy to
other games with the same feature, such as Russian Preferans.

Every bid can now be outbid *either* by bidding a higher *contract*---for
instance, outbidding *Game 6* with *Game 7*---or by bidding a higher
*suit* in the same contract.

There are three suits: *plain*, *in color*, and *in preference*. Each one
determines what suits the bidder can name as trumps if that bid succeeds.

## Plain

If the bid succeeds, the declarer can name any suit as trumps; ♠, ♣, ♦, ♥.

## In color

If the bid succeeds the declarer can only name the suit of preference *or*
the suit of the same color as trumps; in our example, ♦ or ♥.

## In preference

If the bid succeeds the declarer can only name the suit of preference
as trumps.

# Vira with payments

We'll keep score by adding a payment system for successful and
unsuccessful bids. As our unit of currency we'll use **ᵽ**. We'll also
use **Ƀ** to stand for units of 8ᵽ.

## Pool payments

There's a central pool that all players pay into and draw from. Each bid
has a certain amount in Ƀ that players win if they make a bid, and a certain
amount in Ƀ they have to pay into the pool if they lose.

|Bid         |w|l|
|------------|-|-|
|Game 6      |1|1|
|Turn-one 6  |1|1|
|Game 7      |1|1|
|Turn-two 6  |1|2|
|Turn-one 7  |1|1|
|Game 8      |1|1|
|Turn-two 7  |1|2|
|Turn-one 8  |2|1|
|Turn-two 8  |2|2|
|Game 9      |1|1|
|Turn-three 9|3|3|

We can see that the payments are generally the same. The turn- bids are
known as "gambling" bids because they have higher stakes.

## Player payments

In addition to paying out to the pool, bids can also have an amount in
ᵽ associated with them that are paid directly by each opponent to the
declarer in the case of a win, or by the declarer to each opponent in
the case of a loss.

The amount paid here is determined by the suit level of the bid: there
are amounts for a plain bid, a bid in color, and a bid in preference. It's
the same for a win or a loss.

|Bid         |*|c| p|
|------------|-|-|--|
|Game 6      |0|0| 1|
|Turn-one 6  |0|0| 1|
|Game 7      |0|0| 1|
|Turn-two 6  |0|1| 1|
|Turn-one 7  |0|1| 1|
|Game 8      |0|1| 1|
|Turn-two 7  |1|1| 3|
|Turn-one 8  |1|1| 3|
|Turn-two 8  |1|3| 5|
|Game 9      |1|1| 3|
|Turn-three 9|3|5|11|

# Vira with codille

We can increase the stakes and skill level by penalizing players who badly
fail to make their bids. Any time the declarer fails to make their bid by
1 trick, we'll call it a *simple* loss. If they fail by 2 or more tricks,
they've lost by *codille*.

If a player loses by codille, they have to pay a greater amount in
Ƀ to the pool.

|Bid         |w|l|c|
|------------|-|-|-|
|Game 6      |1|1|2|
|Turn-one 6  |1|1|2|
|Game 7      |1|1|2|
|Turn-two 6  |1|2|4|
|Turn-one 7  |1|1|2|
|Game 8      |1|1|2|
|Turn-two 7  |1|2|4|
|Turn-one 8  |2|1|2|
|Turn-two 8  |2|2|4|
|Game 9      |1|1|2|
|Turn-three 9|3|3|6|

# Vira with folding

Now that it's particularly costly to lose badly, players might want
to fold rather than play if it means they can pay for a simple loss,
rather than a codille. In any bid, after the declarer exchanges, they
can choose to fold rather than keep playing. The process is now:

1. Declarer names their trump suit;
2. Declarer discards any number of cards and draws the same number from the stock;
3. Declarer decides to fold or continue;
4. (if declarer continues) Opponents exchange.

# Vira with a second exchange

We can provide a second way for a declarer to cut their losses if, after
their exchange, they think that they won't be able to make their
bid. After their exchange, if they haven't used up the whole stock,
they can actually exchange *a second time*. This obviously provides a
much better shot at making a bid, and therefore will actually, usually,
amount to a net loss. However, the overall loss when winning on the
second exchange will be less than losing by codille on the first.

The order for the declarer now looks like this:

1. Declarer names their trump suit;
2. Declarer discards any number of cards and draws the same number from the stock;
3. Declarer decides to fold, exchange again, or continue;
4. (if declarer continues) Opponents exchange.

If the declarer decides to exchange again they must pay their opponents
as though they've lost. They don't have to pay the pool.

In addition to the payment to their opponents, the win/lose/codille
values are different for a declarer who's exchanged twice:

|Bid         |w|l|c|2nd exch.   |w|l| c|
|------------|-|-|-|------------|-|-|--|
|Game 6      |1|1|2|            |0|3| 5|
|Turn-one 6  |1|1|2|            |0|3| 5|
|Game 7      |1|1|2|            |0|3| 5|
|Turn-two 6  |1|2|4|            |0|6|10|

|Turn-three 9|3|3|6|            |1|9|15|

# Vira with misère

All of the features of the game are now in place. What remains is
introduce the rest of the bids.

The main point as we develop the game is to increase the number of
biddable hands. That is, to introduce different types of bids that favor
other hands so that any player might have a chance at making a bid if
they're lucky.

The basic bids obviously favor *strong* hands; the declarer makes their
bid by making a certain number of tricks, and the bids are ordered by
the number of tricks, so the bidder with the strongest hand will win
their bid. We can introduce *misère* bids, where the aim is to *lose all the tricks*,
in order to give players with very *weak* hands an equal opportunity to bid.

Rules for play at misère are identical to normal play: players must
follow suit and the high card takes the trick. The one difference is
that all misère games are played at *no trump*: the declarer doesn't
declare a trump suit, and no card can take a trick if it isn't of the
the suit that was led. If the declarer takes a single trick, they *lose*
the bid; if they take 2 or more tricks, they lose by *codille*.

## Bids

### Gök

The simplest and easiest misère bid is *gök*. It proceeds as follows:

1. Declarer takes the whole stock;
2. Declarer discards 13 cards;
3. Declarer decides to fold or continue;
4. Declarer turns their hand face-up.

As usual, forehand leads and the declarer then attempts to lose all
13 tricks.

### Misère (1-6)

There are standard misère bids played at levels 1-6. The aim is always
to lose all the tricks; in this case, the levels determine how many
cards are exchanged. The procedure is:

1. Declarer discards the number of cards equal to their bid;
2. Declarer draws the same number from the stock;
3. Declarer decides to fold, exchange again, or continue;
4. (if declarer continues) Opponents exchange.

Before playing, declarer also discards some additional cards.

(level 1) - declarer discards 1 card.
(level 2-6) - declarer discards 2 cards.

The declarer will therefore have fewer cards than the opponents. When
they've played all their cards, the hand is over. Unlike at Gök, the
declarer plays closed.

## Pool payments

Since Gök involves taking the whole stock, no second exchange is
possible.

## Player payments

Since all misère bids are at no-trumps, "in color" and "in preference"
don't apply.

# Vira with choice bids

The final type of "low" bid is *gask*, which allows the declarer to
*choose* after the exchange whether they want to play a trumps game or
at misère.

## Gask (0-5)

Gask is also bid at different levels. Here each level corresponds directly
to the number of cards the player *keeps* when exchanging. If they decide
to play a positive game, the level will also determine how many tricks
they need to take.

The procedure to play a gask contract is as follows:

1. Declarer discards (13 - the level of their bid) cards;
2. Declarer takes the entire stock;
3. Declarer discards a number of cards equal to the level of their bid (back down to 13);
3. Declarer decides to fold or continue;
4. (if declarer continues) depending on the level of the bid:
    - level 0: the declarer may:
        1. name a trump suit; play to win 7 tricks;
        2. discard an additional 2 cards; play misère.
    - level 1: the declarer may:
        1. name a trump suit; play to win 8 tricks;
        2. discard an additional card; play misère.
    - level 2: the declarer may:
        1. name a trump suit; play to win 9 tricks;
        2. discard 0 cards; play misère.
    - level 3: the declarer may:
        1. name a trump suit; play to win 10 tricks;
        2. discard an additional card; turn hand face-up; play misère.
    - level 4: the declarer may:
        1. name a trump suit; play to win 11 tricks;
        2. discard no cards; turn hand face-up; play misère.
    - level 5, level 6: declarer names a trump suit; plays to win 12 tricks.

Gask *may* be bid *in color* and *in preference*; however, such a bid
forces the declarer to play a positive game.

## Pool payments

Since Gask involves taking the entire stock, there is no possibility
for a second exchange. Gask 5 is ranked *higher* than Gask 6.

# Vira with gök conventions

Gök is an odd-man-out contract and has some unique characteristics. Chief
among them is that gök is the only bid which has an established rule
around *passing*: if a player bids gök, their opponents may *not*
pass unless they hold certain cards.

In particular, the opponent after the declarer must hold at least 2 *low
guards*. If they pass, then the third opponent must have at least 1 *low
guard* in order to pass.

If a player passes on this bid without the required cards and the declarer
ends up making their bid, that player must pay an additional penalty of
1 Ƀ into the pool.

## Low guards

A low guard is the low equivalent of a "stop"; that is, a combination
of cards that guarantee the holder will lose at least one trick. They are,
within any single suit, any of the following:

- any 2
- 4-3
- 6-5-4
- 6-5-3
- 8-7-6-5
- 8-7-6-4
- 8-7-6-3
- 8-7-5-4
- 8-7-5-3

# Vira with advanced bids

We can introduce some varsity-level bids now to reward highly-skilled
players, or at least stacked hands. We can add to the table a series of
more challenging bids, where the declarer lacks the advantage of the draw,
or has to take many more tricks, or both.

## Bids

### Solo (6-13)

*Solo* is directly comparable to a standard game bid, with the difference
that the declarer does *not* exchange. It has the same level dynamic,
where the level indicates the number of tricks to be taken.

1. Declarer names their trump suit;
2. Declarer decides to fold or continue;
3. (if declarer continues) Opponents exchange.

### Vira

On the other hand, the eponymous *vira* is a positive analog to
gök. Instead of playing *misère ouverte*, the declarer plays closed
and attempts to take all 13 tricks.

1. Declarer takes the whole stock;
2. Declarer discards 13 cards;
3. Declarer decides to fold or continue;
4. Declarer names their trump suit.

## Pool payments

In solo the declarer doesn't exchange, and in vira the declarer exchanges
the entire talon, so neither one can perform a second exchange.

# Vira with exceptional bids

The final elaboration we can add, completing our bidding table, is a
set of negative contracts roughly equal to solo/vira in terms of rarity.

There are six *solo misère* bids, which are played misère
without exchange. As with all negative bids, the aim is to lose all
tricks. Instead of levels, then, their distinguishing features are:
open/closed, with/without a single discard, and turn up before/after
opponent exchange.

## Bids

Each of the following bids has the same basic structure: declarer does
not exchange, and attempts to lose all tricks. Following are the
structural differences in each contract:

### Solo petite misère

1. Declarer discards 1 card;
2. Opponents exchange.

### Solo grande misère

1. Opponents exchange.

### Solo petite misère ouverte

1. Declarer discards 1 card;
2. Opponents exchange;
3. Declarer turns hand face-up.

### Solo grande misère ouverte

1. Opponents exchange;
2. Declarer turns hand face-up.

### Solo petite misère ouverte royale

1. Declarer discards 1 card;
2. Declarer turns hand face-up;
3. Opponents exchange.

### Solo grande misère ouverte royale

1. Declarer turns hand face-up.
2. Opponents exchange.

In this contract (and only this contract), the opponents can also show
each other their cards and discuss their exchange.

# Vira strategy and background

We are at the final incarnation of our game. There are of course variations:
- different historical versions, some of which are still played;
- regional variations;
- non-structural variations like how to determine preference and how to keep score.

There are also conventions and rules of thumb which some might argue
are integral to the game itself.

For further research, there are two English-language documents that I've
used as source material for this account:

- [the Vira page at Pagat.com](https://www.pagat.com/boston/vira.html)
- [Raymond Gallardo's account on BoardGameGeek](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2158558/how-play-vira)

If I have missed any necessary structural elements, please let me know!
