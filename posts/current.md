title: A Curriculum of Current Phonetic Shorthand
date: 2020-04-05
status: post

Henry Sweet's [Current Shorthand][current][^1] is a historical curiosity
twice over: once because very few people today need to learn shorthand
at all or event know what it is; twice because as shorthands go, it's
completely obscure. I learned about it because the surprisingly active
and enjoyable [Shorthand Subreddit][subreddit] is populated by people who
seem to really enjoy spelunking in digital archives for self-published
books from the late 19th century, the heyday of shorthand, when there
was actual money in designing and publicising a shorthand system of
one's own devising.

[^1]: Current comprises two separate but simpilar systems: *Orthographic*,
which represents spelling; and *Phonetic*, which represents sound. I
think that he imagined a practitioner would learn both. I haven't, and I
don't think you need to either. I learned Phonetic; an interested reader
can probably choose either one.

Nevertheless, insofar as one is already interested in learning a shorthand[^2], it's quite worth taking a look at. I think it has a combination of qualities that make it very recommendable:

- it is *efficient*, compressing quite a bit of writing into a small number of strokes;
- it is (relatively) *cursive*, visually and mechanically resembling longhand writing more than simple ellipses or geometrical shapes;
- by means of the second fact, it is, visually, fairly resistent to ambiguity [(I've talked about this before)][ambiguity].

[^2]: I will assume in this article that the reader has already passed that threshold.

It's also got some marks against it. In addition to being very complex
(or at least involved, or at least *deep*), it is doubly inaccessible:
once because the only extant text that I know about is a [scanned PDF
of Sweet's own handwritten (!) manual from 1892][scan], and twice due
to the fact that the manual is, frankly, not well-laid out.

Part of it is that Sweet was a phonetician before phonetics was a thing;
his vocabulary around different sounds is not the same as we would
use. More difficult is that the signs are actually quite systematic
but Sweet often *leaves the system implicit*; there are a few places
that his choice of symbol names in fact obscures their relationships to
other symbols.

I'd like to try to lay out some of the same information contained in the
manual in a more systematic and searchable way. Let's see if it works out.

# Consonants

The atom of current shorthand is the *[connected vertical
downstroke][minim]*. Because Current mimics normal handwriting, it's
pretty tolerant of different degrees of slant, so "vertical" here is a
relative rather than absolute term.

## Heights

Strokes have four heights:

- *short*, as in the height of a lower-case `x`;
- *high*, as in the height of a lower-case `l` or upper-case `I`;
- *low*, as in the height of a lower-case `y`;
- *tall*, which extends from the top of an `l` to the bottom of a `y`.[^tall]

## Curved or angled

A vertical stroke is connected by the upward stroke that leads into it
and the upward stroke that leads from it. There are two ways to connect
into those strokes: with a curve, and with a sharp angle.

\\[2 \text{ points of connection} × 2 \text{ ways to connect} = 4 \text{ styles of stroke:}\\]

- *stroke*: ![](../images/current/short-stroke.png)
- *curve-stroke*: ![](../images/current/short-curve-stroke.png)
- *stroke-curve*: ![](../images/current/short-stroke-curve.png)
- *curve-stroke-curve*: ![](../images/current/short-swing.png)

[minim]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minim_(palaeography)
[^tall]: *tall* is a bad name, unnecessarily confusable with *high*. *Full* would be more appropriate.

## Stroke Consonants

Constructing a matrix of heights and styles gives us the most basic strokes.

\\[4 \text{ styles of stroke} × 4 \text{ heights} = 16 \text{ strokes:}\\]

|             |stroke                                      |curve-stroke                                      |stroke-curve                                       |curve-stroke-curve                                |
|---------    |--------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------- |--------------------------------------------------|
|**short**    |![](../images/current/short-stroke.png) *t* |![](../images/current/short-curve-stroke.png) *d* |![](../images/current/short-stroke-curve.png) *n*  |![](../images/current/short-swing.png) *r*        |
|**high**     |![](../images/current/high-stroke.png) *p*  |![](../images/current/high-curve-stroke.png) *b*  |![](../images/current/high-stroke-curve.png) *m*   |![](../images/current/high-double-hook.png) *kw** |
|**low**      |![](../images/current/low-stroke.png) *k*   |![](../images/current/low-curve-stroke.png) *g*   |![](../images/current/low-stroke-curve.png) *ng*   |![](../images/current/low-double-hook.png) *ly**  |
|**tall**     |![](../images/current/tall-stroke.png) *tsh*|![](../images/current/tall-curve-stroke.png) *dzh*|![](../images/current/tall-stroke-curve.png) *ny** |![](../images/current/tall-double-hook.png) *ry** |

Arranged thus it's hopefully evident that there's an order to what sign
goes with what sound. Sweet is particularly hot on the correspondence
between where *in the mouth* a sound is articulated and where it's placed,
vertically, on the page (the man was a phonetician), which I think is
less than helpful; however, especially in the upper-left of the matrix,
it hangs together ok.

The basic strokes stand for *unvoiced* sounds, and the curve-strokes
stand for their *voiced* counterparts. It's hopefully useful and intuitive
that /t/ goes with /d/, /k/ with /g/, and so forth.

Similarly, /tsh/ (usually written "ch", like "cheer" and "cheek") and
/dzh/ (one of the sounds made by "g" or "j", as in "George") go together.

The third column is the *nasals*; in English there isn't a voiced/unvoiced
distinction for them.

The fourth column hangs together less cleanly. A short
*curve-stroke-curve* stands for /r/, which is obviously very common
in English; the rest of the column is left over for certain consonants
followed by glide vowels (marked in the table with an asterisk).

## Loop Consonants

The second basic element of the vocabulary is the *loop*, which as a
term is hopefully self-explanatory.

Loops can have the same heights as strokes; however, there are only *two* types of loop:

- *regular*, where the pen starts from the bottom-left, forms a loop, and continues to the bottom-right: ![](../images/current/short-loop.png)
- *inverted*, where the pen starts from the upper-left, forms a loop downwards, and continues to the upper-right: ![](../images/current/short-inverted-loop.png)

\\[2 \text{ styles of loop} × 4 \text{ heights} = 16 \text{ loops:}\\]

|             |loop                                      |inverted loop                                      |
|---------    |------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------- |
|**short**    |![](../images/current/short-loop.png) *s* |![](../images/current/short-inverted-loop.png) *z* |
|**high**     |![](../images/current/high-loop.png) *f*  |![](../images/current/high-inverted-loop.png) *v*  |
|**low**      |![](../images/current/low-loop.png) *zh*  |![](../images/current/low-inverted-loop.png) *sh*  |
|**tall**     |![](../images/current/tall-loop.png) *nzh*|![](../images/current/tall-inverted-loop.png) *nsh*|

The loops are used for what Sweet calls *hiss* sounds but what we'd call
*fricatives*, and mostly *sibilants*. The voiced/unvoiced relationship
of orientation is in place, which is very helpful.

Less helpful is the fact that it *swaps* midway through. In the first
two rows, the left side is unvoiced and the right side is voiced. In
the bottom two, we swap over. Sweet's rationale for this is that /sh/
is more common, and that the low inverted loop is easier to write. I'm
sure he's right, but I don't know if it's worth the added cognitive load.

The tall loops are left for blends involving /n/ + the sound made by their
low counterparts. These are more useful than they seem at first glance,
since in practice /nsh/ also works for /ntsh/ (as in "inch") and /nzh/
also works for /ndzh/ (as in "change").

## Rings

We've covered nearly all the consonants under the above two theories,
but there are a few stagglers that don't fit neatly.

The "canonical" form of /h/, so to speak, is an elongated low ring.

There are two sounds, voiced /th/ and unvoiced /dh/, represented by
"th". They are both short.


|             |ring                                       |half ring                                          |
|---------    |------------------------------------------ |-------------------------------------------------- |
|**short**    |![](../images/current/short-ring.png) *th* |![](../images/current/short-half-ring.png) *dh*    |
|**low**      |![](../images/current/low-ring.png) *h*    |                                                   |

It's important to note, however, that /h/ is much more commonly written
as a long diagonal stroke beginning below the line of writing, like so:
![](../images/current/long-stroke.png)

## Semivowels

The semivowels (or glides) are both written with what Sweet calls the
"flat curve": ![](../images/current/low-flat-curve.png)

|             |flat curve                                     |
|---------    |------------------------------------------     |
|**high**     |![](../images/current/high-flat-curve.png) *w* |
|**low**      |![](../images/current/low-flat-curve.png) *y*  |

As we've already seen, though, there are some blends with /w/ and /y/
that are useful to know as these symbols are a bit awkward to write in
the middle of a word.

## Wave

The final sound to cover is /l/, which is written with a "wave", or what
we might now call a *tilde*: ![](../images/current/wave.png). It's hard
to classify it by height, though I suppose technically it's *short*. But
in reality it's the only consonant whose overall height is less than
that of an `x`.

One result of this is that it can be comfortably written *on the line*
or at around `x` height. The former generally is used when /l/ is not
preceded by a vowel, while the latter is generally used when it is.
