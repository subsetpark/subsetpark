title: The Rodeo Clown Theory of Personal Development
status: draft

## Prelude

A year ago I didn't know what I wanted to do when I grew up. 

I had been in the workforce since I came back to New York in 2005. I had never, blessedly, been out of a job for more than a few months, having working as a temp, then an administrative assistant, before putting in seven years as a computer repair technician. But even within those seven years in a stable job that required at least a modicum of skill, I knew it wasn't what I wanted to *do*, and I didn't know what what I wanted to *do* was.

I had studied programming in high school, and enjoyed it. But it had fallen away and I'd formed the very sticky opinion that I simply wasn't very good at it. Wasn't good enough, anyway, to do it for a living.

Periodically, as I went through my twenties, I would get inklings. There would be some spark of possibility around some interest of mine: maybe I could do this! Maybe I should study manuscripts! Maybe I should be a dharma teacher! Maybe I should become an acoustic engineer!

And more quotidian possibilities: maybe I should be a project manager! Maybe I should be a developer!

## The Rodeo Clown Theory of Personal Development

It seems that there are some people in the world who, at some young point in their lives, figure out what they want to become. Then they become that thing. Want to be a doctor when you're grown up? Better do pre-med when you're a kid, so you can do medical school after college, so you can get a good residency. Want to be a lawyer? Start preparing for law school now. Want to be president? Win Wimbledon? Rock star? You know what to do.
