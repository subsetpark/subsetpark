I've written some code that might be of interest:

### [**gitp**](https://sublime.wbond.net/packages/gitp)
A plugin for Sublime Text 3 that provides a front end to `git add -p`. Read more about add -p [here](http://akaptur.github.io/blog/2012/12/18/git-add-p-the-wave-of-the-future/).

### [**necktie.py**](http://www.neckweb.biz)
A Python library for exploring the world of necktie knots, as elucidated by [Thomas Fink & Young Mao](http://www.tcm.phy.cam.ac.uk/~tmf20/TIES/PAPERS/paper_nature.pdf). Also available in [web app form](http://www.neckweb.biz). [Here's how I came up with it](|filename|/necktie.md).

### [**abba**](http://github.com/subsetpark/abba), the abbreviation engine
