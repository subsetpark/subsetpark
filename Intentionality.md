Title: Intentionality

My girlfriend is English and, though she's lived in the States for quite some time, still uses some vocabulary 

I had an interesting experience just now. C was wondering whether there was an umbrella downstairs. She uses the word 'brolly' and I often have the tendency to simply reuse the word she does, even when it's not in my “idiolect, when she's already used it. So she asked where her brolly was and I answered, 'there's a brolly on the stairs'—or at least, I think I did. I don't actually remember. I remember answering her question, and I remember what the answer was, but I have no idea at all if I said 'brolly' or 'umbrella'.

One reason this is interesting is that it points to the essentiality of metaphor and intentionality in language. I know that I told her there's a \[frame of cloth and metal for keeping off the rain] on the stairs. This is an inherently linguistic act, the act of telling, and yet because I didn't happen to be noting the specific word choices I was making (like most people at most times), I don't remember the words I used at all. But because I was being intentional, because I was speaking *about* a certain thing, my memory of the moment is actually relatively intact.
