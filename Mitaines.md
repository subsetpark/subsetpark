Title: Mitaines
Date: 12-01-2013

In French Canada, according to to [Pagat.com][1], there's a game called [*Mitaines*][2], which means "Mittens" in French. I'm not sure where I first heard about this game, but it stuck with me—because I couldn't fathom, judging from the rules, how it was played, but I knew that the game consisted of building combinations that were called *mittens*, *gloves*, and *socks*. This struck me as adorable and odd. I couldn't find any other information about it; if you google "Mitaines card game", the only results aside from Pagat are pages that seem to derive entirely from Pagat, and earlier works by me, including the [stream][3] on [Thoughtstreams.io][4] that this article is based on. But Pagat is pretty authoritative so I persist in believing that this game exists.

I don't know when I first found out about Mitaines, but I first [mentioned it][5] on the internet in February 2009. It next comes up in August of 2010, but only to say that I had forgotten about it. It wasn't until late last year—the beginning of the Thoughtstream is November 2012—that I actually went to the trouble of learning how to play the game. 

I'll try to establish a basic account of how we play the game. The 'we' is important here: I have never been taught this game by a French Canadian, who might have learned it from other French Canadians. I have never played this game with a French Canadian. I barely know any French Canadians. I have indeed never met anybody who has heard of Mitaines before. In other words, I have accomplished the gaming equivalent of learning a language entirely from a textbook grammar (or, let's be fair, a tourist phrasebook) and, having taught a few friends what I know, claiming fluency.[^1] 

But this is how it works: each player takes turns playing to a central pile. Already, you're being misled: this pile, per se, is not particularly important. You can clear it by playing either a Jack or whatever card is currently on top, but clearing it does almost nothing, most of the time[^2]. There are two things it does:

1. If the ♦10 is in that pile, you score points.
2. It forces whoever comes after you to play to an empty table.

I don't want to poo-poo the ♦10; it's worth 50 points and 50 points is nothing to sneeze at. Nevertheless, I'm used to playing Fishing games (which is what Pagat classifies this as) where the things played to the middle are the things being contested. In this case the pile in the middle is more like the rubbish heap on which something of potential interest is sitting.

The meat of the game is in the aforementioned mittens, socks and gloves. These are pairs, threes of a kind, and fours of a kind, in Poker terminology. And they're captured (in this case the game is very much like other Fishing games—[Scopa][8] comes to mind—where a valuable card or cards in your hand are of no use if you can't safely capture them, which usually requires at least briefly exposing them to danger before they can be whisked off the board) by announcing them and then playing them, one card per turn, for as many turns as it takes to play them all. 

Since it's pretty unusual to draw a lot of threes and fours into a single hand, the game provides a lot of opportunities for you to piggyback off of other players' cards, often coopting their own combinations in the process. I might start to play a mitten, but you can interrupt me if you've got something higher, and I can interrupt you back, each time folding the original calls into the current call, even if the cards themselves don't end up getting played. So you're not exactly playing combinations, or not just playing combinations, but really creating successively grander structures, arrangements of *intention*, that are uneasily superpositioned until somebody finally completes a combination play and scores for everything that had been called before.

Anyway, as I said in my Thoughtstreams post, I learned it along with a willing member of the card game that I had been running for a while and we played through a few hands to get a feel for the mechanics. I liked it but, at least with two players, it was a bit uneventful. 
[^1]:	Not that this is necessarily such a big problem; before a certain period our culture was not as beset with this crippling anxiety over authenticity and cultural ownership as we are now. One can certainly understand some of its origins—there's a large element of bourgeois insecurity that people often ignore, but there is also something unseemly, in our post-colonial society, of barging in on certain cultural practices and matrices without asking permission or particularly caring if you get things right. 

	Beyond that, of course, one sometimes comes up with a [English as She is Spoke][6], but other than that, I still remember the somewhat freeing experience of seeing Tom Wilkinson's Benjamin Franklin in [John Adams][7], blithely chewing his way through the French language, quite clearly with no care paid whatsoever to proper pronunciation, fully understood and obviously untroubled by notions of authenticity or 'passing'.

[^2]:	The exception here is the very first pile of the game, which includes a four-card flop, and any valuable combinations that appear in that flop go to whoever clears the first pile of the game.
