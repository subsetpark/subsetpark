Title: Introversion
Status: draft

There's [another article][1] about introversion [on Hacker News][2] right now.

The top comment right now is a rebuttal of that article, which is an attempt to break down the binary opposition between introversion and extraversion. The article is from the blog of a man who, it looks like, does leadership and self-help writing, and has "LEADERSHIP—MEANING—PASSION" as his subhead, so it's no surprise that it might be looked askance at by introverted geek types like myself. And indeed the rebuttal goes like this: 

> Introversion and extroversion have nothing to do with shyness or how outgoing you are. It has to do with where you derive energy and I disagree with the author of the linked article that introverts just need to practice social interaction.

This is a common conception of the quality of introversion, and widespread—especially in geeky communities like Hacker News. It's repeated like gospel, especially by soi-disant introverts eager to explain themselves in uncontroversial, scientific terms. 

It's actually quite interesting to see it pop up, repeated as an unquestioned fact. Especially interesting because you don't have to think too hard about the topic in even the most general sense before realizing (or remembering) that personality measurement as a whole has always been an ad-hoc, imposed framework. But let's assume that introversion in particular is capable of being modeled. This particular model—the energy-supply model—simply doesn't hold.

In the first place: the assumptions it hinges on are magical and unscientific themselves. 'Energy' is treated in this model like a health bar in a video game, that goes up and down: that is drained by performing certain tasks and is replenished by consuming certain resources%u2014for extraverts, that resource is other people, or their presence, and for introverts it's solitude.

But we know that's not how it works. We, who love to study sleep and hack that as well as everything else, know that there are many ways to be tired. There's the full-body exhaustion after a workout, there's mental fatigue that comes after thinking hard for a long time, there's cramping and lactic acid that comes from using the muscles in a certain way without resting. Some of these require sleep, some physical rest, some a relaxing of concentration.

So what could we actually mean when we say that some people derive energy from being with others and some lose it? The most obvious meaning is obviously false, because we obviously don't mean that for half the population, we get sleepier the more we're around other people, and for the other half, instead of sleeping at night we just go to cocktail parties and emerge refreshed after 8 hours of socialization. 

In the second place, nobody whose social behavior is not truly disordered actually functions according to this dynamic. To take for granted that this is just a function of one's nature—and that one is born with a disposition to one side or the other, in this binary way—ignores the fact that different introverts actually respond differently to different types of company. That's two variables: two introverts who work in the same office (let's say they're developers—no reason) can very easily react differently to being with their coworkers. One finds it draining and one finds it pleasant. But then again, the one who finds it pleasant still finds it draining to be at parties where they don't know anyone. And draining to be at their parents' house for Christmas. And pleasant to be with their spouse.

To bring loved ones into a discussion of introversion and extraversion seems like reductio ad absurdum. Of course introverts find it relaxing and nourishing to be with their loved ones. It's the other people they have a problem with. But is it possible to come to a definition of introversion that so neatly and objectively identifies the single mechanic (deeper than conditioning, habit, self-identity) at work that accounts for the wide variation that different people display in different social circumstances?

Ok, fine. So as a model it's inconsistent. The fact remains: for some people, interactions across certain social channels are draining. After interacting with strangers or large groups they feel exhausted.
